# Friday Night Funkin' FPS Plus: High Effort Complications
This is a mod based off of the game known as Friday Night Funkin, built off of the FPS Plus mod by RoseBud.

## To Do:
- Linux Build || Requirement: Very Low || [ ]
- OSX Build || Requirement: High || [WIP]
- GitHub Actions Support
- Add more to dos.

## FPS Plus' Original Features

### Increased FPS
The orignal purpose of FPS Plus. The game has an increased framerate over the base game and even an option for a completely uncapped framerate.

### Better Input
Adjusts how the game handles input allowing you to hit notes more consistently.

This also changes held notes so that they disappear if released to early.

### Fully Rebindable Keys
So that you can use whatever wacky control scheme you come up with. Or you could just be boring and use DFJK. That works too...

### Improved Chart Editor
FPS Plus contains a modified chart editor that has more utility features and is way more user friendly.

### Improved Animation Debug
The animation debug has been adjusted to make editing offsets way easier and faster while requiring less guess work.

### Downscroll
Notes appear from the top of the screen instead of the bottom. This make help some people read patterns more easily.

### Improved Health Icons
Adjusted some of the health icons and adds winning icons.

## Building
- For build intructions, follow the guide on the Funkin github page [here](https://github.com/ninjamuffin99/Funkin#build-instructions).

    - You do not need to install polymod since FPS Plus doesn't use it.
    
    - You can ignore the part about ignored files since FPS Plus removes them.
